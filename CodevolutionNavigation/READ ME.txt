React Navigation
    - provides a variety pf navigators like Stack, Drawer and Tab navigators
    - provides a way for your app to transition between screens where each new screen is placed on top of a stack
    - drawer navigation renders a navigation drawer on the side of the screen which can be opened and closed via gestures
    - tab navigation at the bottom of screen lets you easily switch between different routes

    npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack

Stack Navigation
    - each new screen is stacked on top of previous one like a deck of cards
    - when you navigate to a new screen, a new card is placed on top of the stack and
      when you navigate back, the top card is removed, revealing the previous screen
    - allows users to drill down into detailed views and the retrace their steps when done
    - particularly useful in scenarios where a linear flow of screens is required
    - list view to details view to more details view

    Stack Navigators
        - javascript-based navigator which offers a high degree of customization,
          greate choice for app that require unique navigation experience
        - comes at the cost of performance when compared to its counterpart, Native Stack Navigator
    Native Stack Navigators
        - leberages the native navigation constructs of iOS and Android, providing better performance
          and a more native feel to the transitions and gestures
        - caveat, might not offer the same level of customization as the Stack Navigator
